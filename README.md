# Go-Chain

Go-based library for interacting with blockchain networks. It simplifies smart contract interactions, transaction building, event listening, and account management, primarily for Ethereum and Ethereum-compatible networks.

### Features

- Smart Contract Interaction:
  - Read/write methods for Ethereum smart contracts.
- Transaction Builder:
  - Build, sign, and send transactions.
- Event Listener:
  - Subscribe and listen to blockchain events in real-time.
- Account Management:
   - Generate, manage, and use wallets and private keys.
- Extendable:
    - Can be adapted for other EVM-compatible networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, etc.

 ### Installation
To install the library, use:

```bash
go get github.com/your-username/playgrounds-go
```

## Usage

### 1. Initialize a Blockchain Client

Connect to an Ethereum client (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, or a local node):


```bash
import (
    "log"

    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
)

func main() {
    client, err := ethclient.Dial("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to connect to Ethereum client: %v", err)
    }
    // Use the client for contract interaction, transactions, etc.
}
```
